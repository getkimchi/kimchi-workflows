/**
 * Structural tests for the one-shot ferment solver
 * (benchmarks/terminal-bench/ferment/ferment-oneshot.workflow.ts), with every agent step scripted and
 * the verification command stubbed — so this pins the WIRING (which stage reads whose output, when a
 * step is re-entered, what the judge is asked) without a model or a container.
 *
 * The thing most worth pinning is the SHAPE of the port: this workflow claims to be kimchi's one-shot
 * ferment minus its nudges, so the tests check both halves of that claim — the ferment's instruction
 * text is present, and its continuation machinery is not.
 *
 * The load-bearing claim as of now: **a step is ONE agent turn that does the work and then answers for
 * it, and no worker is ever dispatched.** kimchi's one-shot orchestrator executes steps directly (31 of
 * 31 `complete_ferment_step` calls across six live runs omit `worker_agent_id`), so a flag is refused
 * back into the session that raised it, which may work some more and answer again.
