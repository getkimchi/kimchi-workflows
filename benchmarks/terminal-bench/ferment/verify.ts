// -- Diff evidence ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// kimchi captures a git ref at `activate_ferment_phase` (`setPhaseStartRef`) and turns the range into
// evidence at `complete_ferment_phase` (`phase-evidence.ts`), so the phase grader sees what actually
// changed instead of only what the agent says changed. Same idea, same caps.
//
// ONE range, the phase's, and that is kimchi's line too. A version of this file also gathered a
// step-scope diff and pasted it into the step's gate turn, because that turn was a cold reviewer that had
// not seen the work and went and re-derived it — 92.4 min of gate turns over one 6-task run, against
// 23 min if each had cost its own task's fastest. The reviewer is gone: the step turn now DOES the work,
// so it holds the edits it made, and what it is handed instead is the one thing kimchi hands its
// orchestrator — the step's start ref. kimchi keeps `stepStartRefs` "(phaseId:stepId → sha) captured at
// start_ferment_step, consumed at complete_ferment_step for diff evidence" (runtime-state-store.ts:11)
// and surfaces the SHA in derived state (derive-state.ts:150). It never assembles a step diff for anyone.
//
// Untracked files ARE part of the phase evidence, and this port had dropped them. kimchi lists them
// (`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`) and synthesises a diff against /dev/null for each, so a
// step that CREATED a file shows up as work. Without it F2's "cite the specific artifact" and the
// grader's independent check both read a phase of new files as a phase that changed nothing — handing a
// reader a diff that omits new files is worse than handing it none.
