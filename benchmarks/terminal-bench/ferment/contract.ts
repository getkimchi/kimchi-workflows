/**
 * The one-shot ferment's vocabulary, ported from kimchi.
 *
 * Everything here has a counterpart in the kimchi checkout, and the port is deliberately literal — a
 * field that exists there exists here, with the same name and the same LLM-visible description, because
 * the point of this workflow is to run the SAME instruction set through the engine instead of through
 * the ferment tool loop:
 *
 *  | here                    | kimchi                                                        |
 *  | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
 *  | `planSchema`            | `ScopeParams` (src/extensions/ferment/tool-schemas.ts)         |
 *  | `refineSchema`          | `RefineParams`                                                 |
 *  | `workerReportSchema`    | `submit_agent_report` (src/extensions/agents/worker-report.ts) |
 *  | `stepGatesSchema` etc.  | `CompleteStepParams.gates` + the gate registry                 |
 *  | `GATE_REGISTRY`         | src/extensions/ferment/gate-registry.ts (verbatim)             |
 *  | `FERMENT_WORKER_BUDGETS`| src/extensions/agents/worker-budget-policy.ts (verbatim)       |
 *
 * What is NOT ported: `ferment_id` / `phase_id` / `step_id` and every other tool-call parameter whose
 * only job was to tell the ferment state machine which record a turn was addressing. The engine's data
 * flow already knows — that is the whole trade this workflow makes.
 *
 * The gate ids that a turn owns are pinned by the schema (a literal union per turn) rather than by
 * kimchi's `assertGateCoverage`, so a missing or misnamed gate is a schema violation the engine steers
 * on, instead of a tool error the model has to be told about.

// -- Gates ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Ported verbatim from kimchi's `gate-registry.ts`: the question and the guidance are prompt text.
 *
 * **Verbatim includes the PERSON, and that is not a stylistic detail.** kimchi writes every gate in the
 * second person — "Read your own summary", "Classify your own verify command honestly", "would make your
 * work fail", "List anything you couldn't do". It is talking to the ORCHESTRATOR: the one long-running
 * ferment session that wrote the plan, DID this step's work, and is about to record its summary. That
 * agent owns the work and wants it to land; the gates are the honesty check it runs on itself before
 * advancing. Six live one-shot runs settle who that is — all 31 `complete_ferment_step` calls omitted
 * `worker_agent_id`, and the orchestrator session spent 108 `bash`, 16 `write` and 13 `edit` calls with
 * zero agent spawns. "Your own summary" is literal: it wrote the summary because it did the work.
 *
 * This port had rewritten the S gates (and F3) into the third person — "Read the step's summary", "the
 * verify command", "this work", "anything that could not be done". Same questions, different addressee:
 * an outside assessor asked whether SOMEONE ELSE'S work is sound. It behaves accordingly. Measured over
 * one live run: S3 flagged 21 times against 15 passes — it refused more often than it passed, on correct
 * work, once flagging a successful `pip install` because "a network outage would cause pip install to
 * fail and there is no offline fallback". Native kimchi over the same tasks: 32 steps, 1 retry, 6/6.
 *
 * The words are the mechanism. Do not paraphrase them.
 *
 * The only substitution left is a tool name with no counterpart here: kimchi's P3/F3 name the
 * `complete_ferment` tool, and this workflow's equivalent is the ship check (`ship`).

 * describes the shape of the work ("narrow for verification or one small edit … complex for multi-file
 * builds"), and the only thing that ever stops the turn is the run's own deadline. So the tier is
 * rendered into the step turn's prompt exactly as kimchi renders it, and nothing enforces it.
 *
 * An earlier version of this port DID enforce it, as `maxDurationMs` on a dispatched worker step, and
 * grew a tier ladder to escalate a worker killed at its cap. Both are gone with the worker: there is no
 * separate process to box when the orchestrator does the work in its own session.
 *
 * `cumulativeTokenBudget` has no counterpart either: it bounded a worker plus its resumptions.
