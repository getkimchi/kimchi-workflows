/**
 * kimchi's one-shot ferment, as a workflow: plan → (phase → (step → verify)* → phase gates)* → ship.
 *
 * This is the ALTERNATIVE to `tb-solver.workflow.ts`, and it is a different bet. `tb-solver` was
 * designed from measured terminal-bench failures and owes kimchi nothing. This one owes kimchi
 * everything: it is a 1:1 rendering of what `kimchi --ferment-oneshot` does — the same planning process,
 * the same P/S/F/C gate registry, the same budget tiers, the same judge standing in for the user, the
 * same verification triage — with exactly one thing removed.
 *
 * ## What is removed, and why it is the whole point
 *
 * In kimchi the ferment lifecycle runs inside ONE session. The model is holding the plan, the phase, the
 * step it is in the middle of doing and the gate verdicts it is about to give, all at once, and after
 * every tool call it has to choose to keep going. When it doesn't, the extension makes it: `maybeInjectFermentStopNudge` re-sends the next
 * action when a turn ends early, `scheduleNextFermentAction` renders "call start_ferment_step now" with
 * the ids filled in, `maybeInjectScopingProgressNudge` counts exploration turns, the lifecycle
 * obligation guard catches text-only stops, and the one-shot envelope carries a "## Turn discipline"
 * section telling it not to stall. That machinery is not decoration — dropping the scope nudge alone
 * accounted for 16 of 31 scored failures in one terminal-bench run.
 *
 * None of it is needed here. The engine decides what runs next, so a step that "stops early" has simply
 * finished; there is no turn to nudge, no lifecycle to remind anyone of, and no way to stall between
 * stages. Every prompt in `prompts.ts` therefore keeps kimchi's instruction text and drops its
 * orchestration text (see that file's header for the line-by-line provenance).
 *
 * ## The other differences, all forced, all small
 *
 * The point of this workflow is that the ONLY interesting variable is engine-vs-session, so everything
 * below is a difference the medium forces, not a design choice — and there is deliberately no scheduling
 * policy of any kind (see "Budgets").
 *
 *  - **Phases and steps run sequentially.** kimchi's `parallel_group` is dropped from the plan schema
 *    rather than silently ignored: a `.foreach` above concurrency 1 requires non-overlapping side
 *    effects (spec §3.4/§8.3), which two agents editing one container's filesystem cannot promise.
 *  - **`budget_tier` moves into the plan.** kimchi picks it per step at `start_ferment_step`; that turn
 *    is orchestration, so the tier is chosen once, at plan time, in the planner's own words. It is
 *    ADVICE in the prompt at both ends — see "Budgets".
 *  - **Structured output replaces tool calls.** A gate payload that was a `complete_ferment_step`
 *    argument is now the step's output schema; the engine validates and steers on it (spec §9.2).
 *  - **Every agent step is `optional`.** In kimchi a failing turn is a tool error the session survives;
 *    here the equivalent is a step whose failure does not take the run down with it.
 *
 * ## The worker that was here, and why it is gone
 *
 * Until now this file dispatched a `worker` subagent per step and had a separate turn rule on its report.
 * **kimchi's one-shot ferment dispatches nobody.** `start_ferment_step` offers both branches in so many
 * words — "Either spawn a subagent … or execute the step directly using bash/edit/write. … If you
 * executed directly, call complete_ferment_step with just the summary and gates (worker_agent_id is
 * optional)" — and six live native runs take the second one every time: all 31 `complete_ferment_step`
 * calls with `worker_agent_id` absent, and the orchestrator session itself spending 108 `bash`, 16
 * `write` and 13 `edit` calls, with zero agent spawns.
 *
 * So a step is ONE agent turn on the orchestrator's own session: it does the work with its tools and then
 * answers S1/S2/S3 about that work. The gate registry's second person stops being a courtesy and becomes
 * a fact — "Read **your own** summary" is addressed to the agent that wrote it because it did the work.
 *
 * Three pieces of machinery went with the worker, and all three were sound repairs to a shape kimchi does
 * not have. They are recorded here rather than quietly deleted, because each was added on measurement:
 *
 *  - the **tier box** (`maxDurationMs` from `FERMENT_WORKER_BUDGETS`), the **landing instruction** ("STOP
 *    WORKING AT Ns AND WRITE YOUR REPORT") and the **kill-and-escalate** ladder (`tierForAttempt`,
 *    `escalateTier`, `worker-landing`). All three existed because a dispatched subagent killed at its cap
 *    returns NOTHING — 46.0 min of one 6-task run went that way, 6 of 11 workers on a single task. There
 *    is no separate process to kill when the orchestrator does the work in its own session, so there is
 *    nothing to box, nothing to land inside, and nothing to escalate;
 *  - the **gate box** (`STEP_GATE_MAX_MS = 180s`), added because a gate turn that was a tool call in
 *    kimchi had become a subagent here and one had run 1472s against a p75 of 57s. The turn it was boxing
 *    no longer exists as a separate turn;
 *  - the **step diff block** (`step-diff`), which pasted a gathered diff into a gate turn that had not
 *    seen the work — 92.4 min of gate turns over that run, against 23 min if each had cost its own task's
 *    fastest. The reader has now made the edits itself, and what it gets instead is the one thing kimchi
 *    gives its orchestrator: the step's start ref (`stepStartRefs`, "consumed at complete_ferment_step for
 *    diff evidence", surfaced as a SHA in `derive-state.ts`). kimchi assembles a step diff for nobody.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 *   scoping = (plan → judge?)*                          until the plan has phases and no open questions
 *   phases  = foreach phase
 *               refine?                                 only a phase the plan left with no steps
 *               steps = foreach step
 *                         (step turn → gate check → verify → triage? → check)*
 *               close = (rework? → F gates → grade? → decide)*
 *   ship    = the C gates                               once every phase is terminal
 *
 * The loops are where a ferment's "refuses advancement" lives, and they are NOT the same refusal. Reading
 * them as one is the single most expensive mistake this port has made:
 *
 *  - a flagged S gate refuses ONE COMPLETION and nothing else. kimchi is explicit: "Step-level flags
 *    don't feed the phase retry/escalation pipeline - they just refuse this single call, and the agent
 *    has to fix the underlying issue and re-call" (tools/steps.ts:427). Nothing is recorded and the
 *    verification never runs — "Gate validation runs BEFORE any state mutation" — and the step turn is
 *    re-entered on its own session holding kimchi's refusal text, where it may work some more before
 *    answering again. That is the same conversation continuing, not a second opinion being bought;
 *  - a verification the triage judge calls real sends the STEP back, into that same session, told what
 *    the command actually printed (kimchi's rule: "a bounded direct continuation … do not raise the
 *    limits and retry the same broad task");
 *  - a PHASE that clears its F gates then has to clear the grader as well — A/B advance, C/D/F refuse
 *    and buy a rework, up to `MAX_BLOCK_RETRIES` times, after which the grade is accepted and the phase
 *    advances anyway. This is the piece of kimchi that is easiest to mistake for a report: the letter
 *    grade drives control flow, and an earlier version of this file omitted it entirely.
 *
 * The first two used to be two nested loops, because one re-ran a cheap gate turn and the other bought a
 * fresh cold worker. Both are now the same act — re-enter the session that did the work — so they are one
 * loop with one counter, and what differs is only what the turn is told and whether the verification is
 * reached.

// -- Budgets -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// NOTHING here is sized from what is left. A ferment runs until the work is done; it never divides a
// budget across its stages, never sizes a turn from the remaining clock, and never tells a model how much
// of the run it may have. Adding any of that would be inventing scheduling policy kimchi does not have,
// and a first run of this workflow showed exactly what that costs: per-stage boxes fed on what earlier
// stages had spent, so `phase-gates` was granted 307ms and `ship` a NEGATIVE box — the two closing gate
// turns never ran, and the ship verdict was decided by arithmetic instead of by evidence.
//
// **A step turn now carries no wall clock at all, and that is the deliberate cost of the merge.** kimchi
// bounds this turn with nothing but the run's own deadline: `complete_ferment_step` is a tool call inside
// a session the harness owns, and the work before it is that same session's tool calls. There is no
// second process to box once the orchestrator does the work, so boxing it would be inventing a bound
// kimchi does not have — which is what the old `worker` tier box and `STEP_GATE_MAX_MS` were, honestly
// arrived at and no longer applicable. The tier survives as PROMPT TEXT, exactly as kimchi's `limitsHint`
// survives on the branch where no Agent is ever spawned.
//
// What that buys, stated plainly: a step turn that runs away now spends the RUN's clock rather than its
// own, and the phases behind it get less. That is the same exposure kimchi carries, at the same level.
//
// The single deadline that does exist is the run's own, and it predates this workflow: `extension.ts`
// aborts the run shortly before the harness would kill it, which cancels whatever is in flight and
// leaves the machine settled. That is the same protection kimchi gets from its harness, at the same
// level — the whole run, not the individual turn.
//
// One constant box is left in this file, on `phase-rework` — the only turn still handed to an agent of
// its own rather than taken by the orchestrator — and it is kimchi's own `standard` tier, not a share of
// anything.

 * instead, each of those turns would meet the others' output as text it was handed.
 *
 * The steps holding this key run strictly sequentially (no `.foreach` here exceeds concurrency 1), which

 * The step: kimchi's `start_ferment_step`, the work, and `complete_ferment_step`, in the one turn that

 *
 * ## Who does the work, and the reading that got this wrong twice
 *
 * kimchi offers its orchestrator two branches at `start_ferment_step`: "Either spawn a subagent … or
 * execute the step directly using bash/edit/write. … If you executed directly, call
 * complete_ferment_step with just the summary and gates (worker_agent_id is optional)". One-shot ferment
 * takes the direct branch every time — 31 of 31 completions across six live runs with `worker_agent_id`
 * absent, 108 `bash` / 16 `write` / 13 `edit` calls made by the orchestrator session itself, 0 spawns.
 *
 * This port modelled the other branch, and paid for it twice over. First it made the gate turn an
 * INDEPENDENT cold reviewer, on the argument that S1 ("does the summary describe work present in the
 * diff?") is "only a real question when you have not written the summary yourself" — which measured 30
 * refusals in 33 step attempts across five runs, the S gates never once passing a step they had already
 * flagged. Then it kept a dispatched worker and merely resumed the reviewer, which fixed the refusals but
 * left a whole extra agent, its box, its landing instruction and its escalation ladder in place — every
 * one of them machinery for a subagent kimchi never spawns.
 *
 * So this is ONE agent step: it does the work with its tools, then answers S1/S2/S3 about what it did.
 * That is what makes the registry's second person literally true — "Read your own summary" is addressed
 * to the agent that wrote the summary because it did the work — and it is why a flag can be refused
 * straight back here (`gate-check`): resolving it is this agent's own turn, in this conversation, with
 * the same tools it used the first time.
 *
 * It shares `ORCHESTRATOR_SESSION` with `plan`, `phase-gates` and `ship`, because in kimchi all of them
 * are turns of one session. No `maxDurationMs`: there is no separate process to box, and kimchi bounds
 * this turn with nothing but the run's deadline (see "Budgets").
